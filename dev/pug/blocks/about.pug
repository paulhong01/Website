					p Hi, welcome to my personal website. I am a Computer Science graduate student at USC. Prior to this degree, I got a M.S. in Communications Engineering and B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. I have 4+ years C/C++ and Java programming experience, and am familiar with SQL, NoSQL(MongoDB) databases as well as computer networking. My passion is to work with extremely talented people and collaborate to develop products that make people better life. I enjoy working on backend and infrastructure to make products be more reliable. In summer 2019, I joined Google as a software engineer intern, which I built status page for network system of GCP and data-plane health check library for Google virtual network to enhance the resilience of GCP.
